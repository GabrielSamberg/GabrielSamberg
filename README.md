## Gabriel Samberg

I am finishing my M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics at Tel Aviv University (TAU), with a focus on mathematically grounded approaches to data analysis and machine learning.

My work spans optimal transport, data matching and clustering, statistics, and applied machine learning. I conduct validated research and am comfortable reading, analyzing, and implementing research papers, moving between theory, algorithms, and empirical evaluation.

### Research Interests

- Optimal transport and related optimization methods
- Data matching and clustering methods
- Tensor algebra and its applications in low rank and dimensionality reduction methods 
- Statistical analysis and data science
- Applied and theoretical machine learning


### Research Profile

- Independent and initiative, conducting research with validation and empirical grounding
- Strong mathematical foundation with practical implementation experience
- Comfortable translating theory into working code
